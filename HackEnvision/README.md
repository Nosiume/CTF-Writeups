# Hack Envision

This is a CTF that I did not participate to since it was reserved for indian participants. But one of my
friends who did participate sent me the PWN challenges for me to try out ! and another funny Misc challenge about
JS obfuscation.

## Summary

- [Pwn01](./pwn01) (basic x64 rip control to a function calling cat flag.txt)
- [Pwn02](./pwn02) (x64 ROP to build arbitrary system call using a string command found in the binary)
- Evil Quark (JS Deobfuscation and very little file analysis)
