Final Rank : #3
Pretty good result here from [my team](https://worldwideflags.team), managing to get #3 and some cool prizes !
As for me, I am really proud of having solved all of the pwn challenges of the ctf as pwn is my main category and the one i'm the most experienced in. Thanks again to the organizers !
